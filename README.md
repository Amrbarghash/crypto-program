# 🔐 Cryptography GUI Tool (Python + Tkinter)

This project was developed as part of the *NTI Summer Training in Network Security*.  
It is an interactive Python application that allows users to experiment with classical cryptographic ciphers through a simple GUI built with *Tkinter*.

## 📝 Project Overview
The tool provides both *encryption and decryption* functionalities for a variety of well-known classical ciphers, with support for *multi-layer encryption*.  

## 🚀 Features
- 🔁 *Caesar Cipher* — Shift-based substitution  
- 🔐 *Vigenère Cipher* — Keyword-based poly-alphabetic cipher  
- 🧩 *Playfair Cipher* — Digraph substitution with 5x5 matrix key  
- 🔠 *Monoalphabetic Cipher* — Full alphabet substitution mapping  
- 🛤 *Rail Fence Cipher* — Zigzag transposition  
- 🧮 *Row Transposition Cipher* — Text rearrangement using numeric key  
- 🧬 *Multi-Layer Encryption* — Combine multiple ciphers for added security
